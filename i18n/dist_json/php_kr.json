  "WhatHalvingAsk1": "Bitcoin halving, also known as bitcoin block reward halving, means that the reward received for producing new blocks is halved approximately every four years. This means that after the halving, each mined block is worth half the amount of bitcoin that was awarded before the halving. When Bitcoin came into existence in 2009, its block reward was 50 BTC. The block reward halves about every four years based on block time and will eventually reach its finite total supply of 21 million.",
  "WhatHalvingAsk2": "So far, Bitcoin has been halved three times, occurring in November 2012, July 2016 and May 2020. The fourth bitcoin halving is expected to occur in May 2024. By that time, the reward will decrease from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC.",
  "WhyDoesBitcoinHalve": "Why does Bitcoin halve?",
  "WhyDoesBitcoinHalveAsk": "According to supply and demand theory, if a commodity does not limit its supply in circulation, excessive supply will occur, and its price will fall. This concept applies to bitcoin too. Using halving to limit its amount and circulation can increase scarcity and make it more valuable. The block reward of Bitcoin is programmed to cut in half every 210,00 blocks, which can slow down the inflation rate and allow new coins to enter into circulation in a controlled manner. Bitcoin halving is also a distinct feature that sets it apart from traditional fiat currencies.",

  "WelcomeEth2": "According to the latest statistics, the ETH 2.0 deposit contract is now holding over 900,000 ETH! Following Ethereum’s Beacon Chain launch on December 1st, the new consensus mechanism is live. Gate.io is providing a flexible ETH 2.0 staking solution to our users, where you can start staking simply by holding ETH 2.0 and a certificate of participation from Gate.io. 1 ETH 2.0 token represents 1 ETH being staked in the eth2.0 network",
  "ForCoinTrade": "%s/%s",
  "WhyUpgradeETH2": "Why does ETH need to upgrade to ETH 2.0?",
  "UpgradeReason1": "<div>1.Higher Scalability</div>ETH1.0 can only handle 15 transactions per second. The upgraded ETH2.0 will spread the load of the network into 64 (maybe more in the future) new chains. Theoretically, ETH2.0 is capable of handling thousands or even tens of thousands of transactions per second. In addition, it fixes the problem of over-concentration of main network computing and improves the scalability further.",
  "UpgradeReason2": "<div>2.Environmental Sustainability</div>Currently, Ethereum is moving towards being secured by PoW. Although there are great advantages when it comes to PoW ensuring the security and decentralization aspect, it is expensive for nodes to safeguard the security of the network. In the end, only one node can find the correct hash value and get the block reward. But all the global participating nodes have paid enormous computing power and electricity, which is not only inefficient but also a waste of environmental resources. While upgrading to the PoS consensus mechanism, ETH will no longer rely on tremendous computing power and electricity to maintain and operate the network but rely on token-staking equity verification to create blocks and trade in the chain.",
  "ETH2Development": "The process of ETH2.0 development",
  "LikeETH1": "Like ETH1.0, ETH2.0 is divided into several phases. The most important of these are phase 0, phase 1 and phase 2.",
  "StagePhase0": "<b>Phase 0: Beacon Chain</b>This is the very first phase of ETH2.0 which will implement the beacon chain. As a new chain, the beacon chain is responsible for validators’ participation of stakings, so as to maintain the network. It is also the order and control center of the ETH2.0 eco. ETH2.0 network in phase 0 does not support functions such as smart contracts, asset transfers and so on. The only available program is verification. Users can not transfer their assets to an exchange in this phase.",
  "StagePhase1": "<b>Phase 1: Sharding</b>The main goal of phase 1 is to integrate ETH1.0 with ETH2.0. A shard chain essentially is an expansion mechanism of the ETH network, which splits the ETH blockchain into 64 different chains and distributes the data processing tasks to many nodes, allowing them to process these data parallel. Each sharding chain acts as a diversion lane of the congested ETH networks to dramatically improve the processing capacity of the network and produce a higher throughput. Click to get the sharding roadmap: https://eth.wiki/en/sharding/sharding-roadmap",
  "StagePhase2": "<b>Phase 2: Execution</b>The current definitions and functions of phase 2 are still under exploration. Phase 2 will comprehensively improve the sharding functions. Each shard will govern EVM based on eWASM and will be compatible with smart contracts. At the same time, it can transfer, withdraw and cross-shard transfer. This phase will finish the integration of ETH1.0 and ETH2.0 and put an end to the PoW consensus mechanism.",
  "WhatIseWASM": "eWASM (ETH WASM) is ETH2.0's solution targeted with ethereum virtual machine (EVM)’s bottleneck problem. EVMs are responsible for the internal state of the ETH network and all of its computings, which has a significant impact on the speed of performing tasks and the overall availability of the network. The eWASM is a W3C community group open standard instruction set and is developed by top engineers from Google, Microsoft, Apple, etc. It supports traditional programming languages, for example C/C++, and 64-bit data processing. It will also increase network processing speed and throughput, as well as security and availability.",
  "BecomeValidator": "How do I become a validator of ETH2.0?",
  "DepositContract": "First, users need to stake 32 ether to the deposit contract:",
  "RunBothTerminals": "Then they should run both ETH1.0 and ETH2.0 terminals at the same time to become a validator. As a validator, the node must stay online for a long time. Validators will get a reward from ETH when they successfully verified one block, with an APR staking interest of about 5-10%. However, if the validator missed the task of verification of the ETH network allocated by the beacon chain due to being offline, he will be fined. Malicious intentions and wrong verification will lead to confiscating the staked 32 Ether.",
  "IrreversibleTransaction": "The ETH staked to the deposit contract is an irreversible transaction. Validators will have the possibility to transfer their funds until ETH2.0 reaches phase 1. Consequently, it still needs two or three years for ETH2.0 to completely have access to sharding and smart contracts, which means that validators will face the risk of being incapable of withdrawing ETH for at least 2 years. In addition, once mortgaged to the beacon chain, ETH will generate BETH and can not return to the ETH1.0 mainchain. If ETH2.0 fails to upgrade, losses may occur. As a result, it is not recommended that ordinary users become validators.",
  "StakingETHEnabled": "Gate.io enables ETH2.0 Staking",
  "EthereumUpgrade": "According to news regarding the Ethereum upgrade, the ETH2.0 staking deposit contract has reached the minimum deposit requirement for the launch of phase 0 on December 1st, 2020. Following the Phase 0 launch, ETH holders were able to participate in PoS staking by depositing their ETH on ETH2.0 to earn rewards.",
  "Eth2Staking": "Taking part in ETH2.0 staking is not easy. It demands a higher technical expertise and requires a long staking time (estimated 1-2 years, which may vary as ETH2.0 develops). Moreover, you must run a validator on both the ETH1.0 chain and the ETH2.0 Beacon Chain at the same time and maintain a stable staking status while doing so. Otherwise, your funds in staking may be charged penalties.",
  "ETH2TokenTransaction": "ETH2.0 Token Transaction",
  "LowerStakingThreshold": "Due to the high barriers of entry, eth2 staking is not suitable for every user. To give all users a chance to participate in eth2 staking, Gate.io will provide a flexible eth2 staking solution to users, based on our stably running Ethereum infrastructure and maturity asset management solution.\n        With this solution, users can earn a staking reward while not needing to lock their ETH in eth2 for a long time or worry about eth2 penalties.\n        Below you can find more details about our eth2 staking solution.",
  "LowerThreshold1": "Gate.io will list ETH2 tokens, which will be the certificate for users to participate in ETH2 staking. 1 ETH2 represents 1 ETH locked in ETH2 staking. Holding ETH2 is equal to participating in ETH2 staking.",
  "LowerThreshold2": "Users will be able to buy or sell ETH2 on USDT and ETH markets freely.",
  "LowerThreshold3": "Gate.io will distribute the net income (staking income minus cost) from eth2 staking to ETH2 holders as eth2 staking starts.",
  "LowerThreshold4": "The staking reward will be in the form of ETH2.O, allocated based on users’ average ETH2 holdings over a period of 14 days.",
  "LowerThreshold5": "Currently, validators are waiting in line for the chance of staking on ETH2. It may take a few days to start staking after ETH2 launches (the delay may vary , depending on the length of the waiting list).",
  "LowerThreshold6": "The yearly reward % of ETH2 staking is related to the amount of ETH being staked. The yield tends to be higher at an early stage as less ETH is being staked. In the long term, the yield is expected to be stable around 5%-10%.",

Other than that, stablecoins such as %s offer a financial hedge for people from high inflation economies with a more stable currency in the form of crypto.",

  "Stable-Coin-FAQ-Content4": "Fiat backed stablecoins are maintained by cash reserves of a fiat currency such as USD or EUR, whereas crypto collateralized stablecoins are pegged to holdings of other cryptocurrencies such as BTC or ETH, instead of fiat currencies.",
  "Stable-Coin-FAQ-Content5": "The most controversial of all would be algorithmic stablecoins, which are built on a blockchain and rely on a supply-and-demand algorithm to maintain the 1:1 price peg. As the demand increases to drive the price up, the protocol issues more supply to drop the price back to its pegged $1.00 price, and vice versa.",

  "faq.3": "How to redeem?",
  "faq.1.1": "Simple Earn matches users' idle funds with loan demand to help generate passive income on users’ lent assets. Instead of using a fixed interest rate throughout the entire loan duration, Simple Earn settles interest with updated execution interest rate hourly based on market conditions automatically, thus providing more flexibility and increased capital efficiency for lenders. As a lender, you can join the program any time and receive a better interest rate than you preset, with your lent funds becoming accessible again with a maximum delay of 1-hour when you exit.",
  "faq.2.1": "At the end of an hour (also the very start of the next hour , ie,X:00:00), a single interest rate will be figured out as the execution interest rate and applied retroactively to all eligible lending over the past hour. The interest is offered in tranches based on whether the funds’ minimum interest rate is below, equal to or above the execution interest rate. Funds provided with the minimum interest rate below the execution interest rate will receive interest first. If there is any remaining interest, they will go to funds provided with the minimum interest rate equal to the execution interest rate, on a first-come, first-served basis. Funds provided with the minimum interest rate above the execution interest rate will not receive any interest. If your assets are borrowed successfully on the hour at T, you will receive the interest earned during the following hour at T+1. However, if you redeem your assets before the T+1 settlement, you will not receive any interest for the past hour. Interest received every hour will be invested automatically to earn compound interest. You can redeem both principal and interest at redemption.",
  "faq.3.1": "You can join or exit Simple Earn anytime you want. Redeemed assets will be returned to your account immediately. Please note that if you apply to redeem assets when the Borrowed Percentage is 100%, which means all lending offers are borrowed, you will receive the assets once there are available funds in the pool. Please wait patiently and interest will keep accruing during this period.",

  "ETH2_FAQ_MAIN": "### What is ETH staking?\nAs a proof-of-stake network, Ethereum allows its holders to stake their ETH to secure the network and earn rewards. However, staking directly through the Ethereum network requires at least32 ETH.\nGate.io streamlines ETH onchain staking by running node on behalf of users and allowing a minimum of 0.000001 ETH staking threshold. After staking ETH at Gate.io, you will get ETH2 as the tokenized representation of your staked ETH and rewards.\n### What is ETH2 and what can I do with it?\nETH2 is a reward-generating liquid staking token and the representation of your staked ETH at a 1:1 ratio.\nETH2 provides you with higher liquidity and more return opportunities besides earning rewards, including:\n·  ETH2/ETH & ETH2/USDT spot trading\n· Use ETH2 as your loan collateral\n### ETH Staking \nIf you start staking during 00:00~23:59 (UTC), you will be able to check your rewards in the form of ETH2 in your spot account from the next day.\nMIN Staking Amount 0.000001 ETH\nDaily Max Staking Amount per Person 0.000001 ETH\nConversion Rate 1ETH=1ETH2\nTerm Flexible\n### ETH Redeeming\nAs a ETH2 holder you can redeem your ETH2 back to EHT at a 1:1 ratio. Your staking amount will be returned to your account immediately after submitting a redemption request.\nThe count of staking and redemption is limited to max 20 times per day.\n### How will my rewards be calculated?\nAfter staking ETH, rewards will be released in the form of ETH2 based on the amount of staked ETH.\nEst. APR is calculated based on the total amount of ETH2 rewards earned by Gate.io validators on the Ethereum blockchain and is subject to daily market fluctuations.\nETH2 rewards = ETH2 holding * daily APR/365\n### When will the max staking amount be reset?\nThe daily max stake and redeem limit resets every 24 hours, starting from the time of your first stake or redeem operation.",
  "ETH2_FAQ_COMMON": "### Advantages of Gate.io ETH2.0\nGate.io provides a flexible ETH2.0 staking solution to users based on its securely running Ethereum infrastructure and mature asset management solution. The advantages are as follows: \n \n Great Capital Efficiency\n \nUsers can buy or sell ETH2 in USDT and ETH markets freely.\n \nETH2 token is also a certificate for participating in ETH2.0 Staking. By holding ETH2, you are participating in ETH2.0 Staking.\n \nParticipating in Gate.io ETH2.0 Staking will not affect your VIP tier, and you can still enjoy all privileges of your VIP tier.\n \nGate.io is committed to maintaining users' VIP privileges while they are participating in ETH2.0 Staking for a more comprehensive and seamless trading experience.\n \nSteady Return\n \nGate.io will distribute the net income from ETH2.0 Staking to EHT2 holders.\n \nThe staking reward is distributed in the form of ETH2 based on users' average ETH2 holdings over a period of 14 days.\n \nThe APR of ETH2.0 Staking is related to the amount of ETH being staked. The yield tends to be higher at an early stage as less ETH is being staked. In the long term, the yield is expected to be stable around 3%-10%.\n \nLow Entry Barrier\n \nETH2.0 Staking has a relatively high entry barrier for ordinary users as participants need to hold at least 32 ETH.\n \nHowever, in Gate.io, you can participate in ETH2.0 Staking by simply buying or converting to ETH2 tokens and earn on-chain rewards.\n### Gate.io ETH2.0 solution\nImprove Scalability\n \nETH1.0 only supports about 15 transactions per second. After the ETH2.0 upgrade, it will eventually be divided into 64 (maybe more in the future) shards, which theoretically enables the network to complete thousands or even tens of thousands of transactions per second. ETH2.0 solves the problem that the computing power of the main network is too concentrated, and further improves the scalability.\n \nEnvironmental Sustainability\n \nCurrently, Ethereum is using the PoW mechanism to operate and safeguard the network security. Despite PoW's advantages of ensuring security and decentralization, it is expensive for nodes to safeguard the security of the network. In the end, only one node can find the correct hash value and get the block reward. But all the global participating nodes have paid enormous computing power and electricity, which is not only inefficient but also a waste of environmental resources. While upgrading to the PoS consensus mechanism, ETH will no longer rely on tremendous computing power and electricity to maintain and operate the network but rely on token-staking equity verification to create blocks and trade on the chain.\n### Roadmap of ETH 2.0 development\nLike ETH 1.0, ETH 2.0 is also divided into several phases. And the most important of these are Phase 0, Phase 1 and Phase 2.\n \nPhase 0: Beacon Chain\n \nThis is the very first phase of ETH2 which will implement the beacon chain. As a new chain, beacon chain is responsible for validators' participation of stakings, so as to maintain the network. It is also the order and control center of the ETH 2.0 eco. ETH 2.0 network in phase 0 does not support functions such as smart contracts, asset transfers and so on. The only available program is verification. Users can not transfer their assets to an exchange in this phase.\n \nPhase 1: Sharding\n \nThe goal of phase 1 mainly is to integrate ETH 1.0 with ETH 2.0. A shard chain essentially is an expansion mechanism of the ETH network, which splits the ETH blockchain into 64 different chains and distributes the data processing tasks to many nodes, allowing them to process these data in parallel. Each shade chain acts as a diversion lane of the congested ETH networks, so as to dramatically improve the processing capacity of the network and produce a higher throughput.\n \n[Click to get the sharding roadmap](https://ethereum.org)\n \nPhase 2: Execution\n \nThe current definitions and functions of phase 2 are still under exploration. Phase 2 will comprehensively improve the sharding functions.Each shard will govern EVM based on eWASM and be compatible with smart contracts and, at the same time, can transfer, withdraw and cross-shard transfer. This phase will finish the integration of ETH 1.0 and ETH 2.0. and put an end to the PoW consensus mechanism.\n### How to become a validator of ETH 2.0?\n \nAt first, users need to stake 32 ether to the deposit contract: `https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000219ab540356cBB839Cbe05303d7705Fa#tokentxns` Then they should run both ETH 1.0 and ETH 2.0 terminals at the same time to become a validator. As a validator, the node must keep online for a long time. Validators will get a reward from ETH when they successfully verified one block, with an APR of staking interest of about 5-10%. However, if the validator missed the task of verification of the ETH network allocated by the beacon chain due being offline, he would be fined. Malicious and wrong verification will lead to confiscating the staked 32 Ether.\n \nThe ETH staked to the deposit contract is an irreversible transaction. Validators will have a possibility to transfer their funds until ETH 2.0 reaches phase 1. Consequently, it still needs two or three years for ETH 2.0 to completely have access to sharding and smart contracts, which means that validators will face the risk of being incapable of withdrawing ETH for at least 2 years. In addition, once mortgaged to the beacon chain, ETH will generate BETH and can not return to the ETH 1.0 mainchain. If ETH 2.0 fails to upgrade, losses may occur to users. As a result, it is not recommended that ordinary users become validators.\n### ETH2.0 Staking enabled on Gate.io\n \nFollowing the ETH2.0 Phase 0 launch, ETH holders will be able to participate in PoS staking by depositing their ETH on ETH2.0 to earn rewards.\n \nTaking part in ETH2.0 staking is not easy. It demands a general higher technical expertise, and requires a long staking time. Moreover, you must run a validator on both the ETH1.0 chain and the ETH2.0 Beacon Chain at the same time and maintain a stable staking status while doing so. Otherwise, your funds in staking may be charged penalties.\n### ETH2 token transaction\n \nDue to the high barriers of entry, ETH2.0 Staking is not suitable for every user. To give all users a chance to participate in ETH2.0 Staking, Gate.io will provide a flexible ETH2.0 Staking solution to users, based on our stably running Ethereum infrastructure and mature asset management solution. With this solution, users can earn a staking reward while not needing to lock their ETH in ETH2.0 for a long time or worry about ETH2.0 penalties. Below you can find more details about our ETH2.0 Staking solution.\n1. Gate.io will list ETH2 tokens, which will be the certificate for users to participate in ETH2 staking. 1 ETH2 represents 1 ETH locked in ETH2 staking. Holding ETH2 is equal to participating in ETH2 staking.\n2. Users will be able to buy or sell ETH2 on USDT and ETH markets freely.\n3. Gate.io will distribute the net income (staking reward minus cost) from ETH2.0 staking to ETH2 holders as ETH2.0 staking starts.\n4. The staking reward will be in the form of ETH2, distributed based on users' average ETH2 holdings over a period of 14 days.\n5. Currently, validators are waiting in line for the chance of staking on ETH2.0. It may take a few days to start staking after ETH2 launches (the delay may vary, depending on the length of the waiting list).\n6. The APR of ETH2.0 staking is related to the amount of ETH being staked. The yield tends to be higher at an early stage as less ETH is being staked. In the long term, the yield is expected to be stable, around 5%-10%.",

What is GT Staking?\n  GT Staking is the process of participating in the Gate.io Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, during which GT holders stake their GTs to protect the network and earn rewards.\nGate.io streamlines GT on-chain staking by running node on behalf of users and providing a minimum of 1 GT staking threshold. After staking GT at Gate.io, you will get GT2 as the tokenized representation of your staked GT and rewards.。\n### 2. GT Staking Rules\n  If you stake GT on a given calendar day (00:00 - 23:59 UTC), staking reward will be released in the form of GT2 the next day.\n  The minimum staking amount is 1 GT.\n### 3. GT Redemption Rules\n  As a GT2 holder, you can redeem your GT2 back to GT at a 1:1 ratio. Your principal and return will be credited to your account immediately after submitting a redemption request.\nRedemption is limited to a maximum of 1,000,000 GT within 24 hours.",
  "COIN_STAKING_COMMON": "### 1. Why is the Est. APR changing and how is it calculated?\n  The Est. APR is dynamically changing on a daily basis along with on-chain staked principal and returns. In order to ensure the sustainability of the product, 5% of the staking rewards will be charged as a staking fee. Staking reward will be released the next day after staking.\n### 2. How is my return calculated?\n  After staking GT, rewards will be released in the form of GT2 based on the amount of staked GT.\n  Est. APR is calculated based on the total amount of GT2 reward earned by Gate.io validators on the Gate.io blockchain and is subject to daily market fluctuations.\n  GT2 return = GT2 holding amount × daily APR / 365 × (1 - staking fee)\n### 3. How long does it take to receive rewards after staking?\n  If you stake on day D, interest will be distributed on D+1.\n### 4. Can I redeem my GT2 return at any time?\n  GT2 returns can be redeemed at any time and will be credited to your account immediately after submitting the redemption request.\n### 5. Is GT2 safe?\n  GT2 is safe and secure and can be redeemed for GT at any time on the GT Staking page.\n### 6. Does GT Staking require identity verification?\n  Yes. Participation in GT Staking requires completing the identity verification first.\n### 7. Can I use sub-accounts to participate in GT Staking?\n   Yes. Sub-accounts are supported for GT Staking.\n### 8. Can I cancel a staking or redemption order after submission?\n   No. The order cannot be canceled. But you can stake or redeem your GT again through GT Staking at any time.",
